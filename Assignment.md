``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'dplyr'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    ## 
    ##     filter, lag

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

``` r
library(rmarkdown)
library(devtools)
```

    ## Loading required package: usethis

``` r
library(fishualize)
library(raster)
```

    ## Loading required package: sp

    ## The legacy packages maptools, rgdal, and rgeos, underpinning the sp package,
    ## which was just loaded, will retire in October 2023.
    ## Please refer to R-spatial evolution reports for details, especially
    ## https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html.
    ## It may be desirable to make the sf package available;
    ## package maintainers should consider adding sf to Suggests:.
    ## The sp package is now running under evolution status 2
    ##      (status 2 uses the sf package in place of rgdal)

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'raster'

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':
    ## 
    ##     select

``` r
library(raster)
library(habtools)
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'habtools'

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:raster':

    ##     extent

``` r
library(devtools)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(fishualize)

plot(horseshoe)
```

### Current Lab

Johansen Fish Resilience Lab

### Project Focus

Imu kai as artificial reef systems

### Why you chose this course

I chose to enroll in this course because I am interested in learning
more about structure for motion and how I can apply this technique into
my own project.

### What do you want to learn about the most in this course

I would like to learn more about how to effectively measure habitat
complexity as vertical topography changes.

### Your R experience

I have taken a couple R courses and still navigating my way through this
amazing program. I hope that this course will help me feel more
comfortable with R and gain several new skills.

### Fun fact

My favorite food is crab!
